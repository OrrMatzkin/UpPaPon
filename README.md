# UpPaPon

As part of my high school studies in Computer Science I participated in an academic enrichment program at Weizmann Institute of Science. I Planed, builded and published my first Android app called UpPaPon.

UpPaPon is social game my friends and I used to play at our youth movement "Bnei Hamoshavim".

## Instructions
The goal is to survive as many rounds as possible, in order to win you must be one of the last 3 remaining players. 

There are 2 types of interactions: the first is with a neighbor player, called "Up" and "Pon" ans the other type is with far distanced players, called "Clap".
There is a certian order of making interactions: Up -> Pon -> Clap -> Up -> Pon -> Clap -> ... and so on.
If you make a wrong interaction or not fast enough you lose. You make an interaction by sliding your finger on the intened place, either right or left, depanding whom you want to make the interaction with.
